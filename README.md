### Summary

> BlockTurk is a decentralized machine learning labelling platform backed by the blockchain. The demand for labelled data is only growing in today's age, where large AI and ML models require pristine labels for accurate result. The goal of our product is to allow anyone with a wallet to submit data that needs to be labelled, and leverage a global network of workers to earn rewards for correctly labelling that data.
